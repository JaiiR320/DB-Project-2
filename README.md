# Section 2
It seems as though all processes are functioning as intended

# Section 3
I used VSCode to write the program, so you may have to manually compile the project.
You could also just make a new project in your IDE and paste the source files in.

Timing the algorithms happen between the actual data collection and not including the print statements. Printing takes a long time which is not relevant to the time the actual algorithm takes to acquire the data. That is why someitmes if ou select a large range or get a lot of data, the time print statements might be too far above the record prints. I suggest making your terminal buffer height really large so that you can scroll up to see those prints.
